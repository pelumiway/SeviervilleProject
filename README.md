# SeviervilleProject
A Visual Guide Navigating the Waters: Understanding Flood Risk in Sevierville using location analysis 


Took a basic map of Sevierville town and started creating layers on it for relevant data.
Imported a vector layer to find GIS links along the areas around the Sevierville to define the boundary and study area.
Imported a vector layer to show Flood way in blue color using FEMA dataset on the website to show the way of flood towards the prone areas.
Inserted flood categories (Red, Pink, Dark Blue) to show the areas that can be affected badly and have a high chance of flooding around the water areas. This data is based on the US Census dataset.
Imported a vector layer in Orange color to show Flood data of the affected areas over the last 100 years in the way of water flowing.
Imported a vector layer to show city limits in already created flood disaster map to show the city boundaries.
