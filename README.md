A Visual Guide Navigating the Waters: Understanding Flood Risk in Sevierville using location analysis 


Took a basic map of Sevierville town and started creating layers on it for relevant data.
Imported a vector layer to find GIS links along the areas around the Sevierville to define the boundary and study area.
Imported a vector layer to show Flood way in blue color using FEMA dataset on the website to show the way of flood towards the prone areas.
Inserted flood categories (Red, Pink, Dark Blue) to show the areas that can be affected badly and have a high chance of flooding around the water areas. This data is based on the US Census dataset.
Imported a vector layer in Orange color to show Flood data of the affected areas over the last 100 years in the way of water flowing.
Imported a vector layer to show city limits in already created flood disaster map to show the city boundaries.
Introduction:
For Project: Rural Tennessee, I have selected the town of Sevierville, Tennessee, as the focus of my analysis. Sevierville offers a unique blend of factors that make it an ideal choice for this project:
Population: With a population of approximately 17,987 residents, Sevierville falls within the desired range of 5,000 and 50,000, making it representative of a small rural town.
Diverse Landscape: Situated near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Sevierville is susceptible to various natural disasters, including landslides, wildfires, and floods. This diversity provides ample data for analysis and understanding disaster preparedness in different contexts.
Data Accessibility: The availability of data for Sevierville is good, with resources available from FEMA, the US Census Bureau, the USGA, and other government agencies. This allows for a comprehensive assessment of the town's vulnerabilities and preparedness.
Tourism Significance: Sevierville boasts a thriving tourism industry, making it a vital economic hub for the region. Understanding disaster preparedness in this context becomes crucial for ensuring the safety of residents and tourists alike.
